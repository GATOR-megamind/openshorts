"""Find subtitles already burned into the source, so ours do not stack on them.

A TV show re-upload came with its own subtitles burned into the bottom of the
picture. The pipeline then burned its own captions as well, and every clip
carried two layers of text: ours just above the source's, the source's cut off
at both sides wherever the 9:16 crop was narrower than the line.

The fix keeps one layer, ours, by trimming the source's subtitle band off the
bottom of every cut clip before it is reframed (``crop_filter``). Cropping from
the bottom keeps the top-left origin, so every face box and crop position the
reframer computes is unchanged; only the height shrinks.

The question goes to Gemini on the same 12 stills at 1024px the layout picker
uses, asked once per source video. It is a separate call on purpose: the layout
prompt's accuracy was measured as is, and a second question in its schema
would change what was measured. Per frame, the model gives the top of the
subtitle text or null; the decision (present in at least half the frames) and
the band (the highest line seen, plus a margin) are made here. The band is a
position, not a routing decision: off by a few percent it trims a sliver more or
less, it never changes a layout.

Off with ``SUBTITLE_BAND_CHECK=0``. Any failure means "no subtitles": the clip
renders exactly as it did before this module existed.
