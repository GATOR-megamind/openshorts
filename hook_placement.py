"""Where the hook text goes when nobody picked a spot (``position="auto"``).

The hook used to sit at a fixed 20% of the frame height. On a 9:16 clip that
is exactly where the speaker's face is: a face-tracked TRACK crop puts the
eyes around a third of the way down, and on a SPLIT clip the top speaker's
face fills the upper half (6-oct-2026: hooks drawn over the forehead of a
TRACK speaker and over the face of the top SPLIT speaker while the captions
sat correctly on the seam).

The rule, kept deliberately simple:

- The hook may go anywhere between the platform's top UI (``TOP_MARGIN``) and
  its bottom UI (``BOTTOM_UI``), but never on a caption band. Captions are
  known without looking: at the bottom on every layout, on the seam
  (mid-frame) on SPLIT stretches (``layout_ranges``, ``subtitles.generate_ass``).
- Inside those bounds, every candidate height is scored by how much of the
  faces it would cover, averaged over a few frames of the hook's own time
  window. Faces are MediaPipe boxes grown upwards to include the forehead
  and hair, since the hook on a forehead reads as "over the face" too.
- The lowest score wins; ties go to the candidate closest to the old 20%
  spot (``MOVE_PENALTY``), so a clip with no face anywhere (gameplay, a
  slide) renders exactly as before.

The scoring is pure (normalised boxes in, a height out) so it is tested with
synthetic faces; ``detect_faces`` is the only part that touches pixels.
